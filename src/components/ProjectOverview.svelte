                During my internship at UCLA's micro and nano manufacturing lab, I was tasked with designing a website centered around building a <strong>community</strong> 
                for digital microfluidics enthusiasts, welcoming both beginners and experts in the field. The goal was to create a platform that would 
                inspire <strong>collaboration and innovation</strong> in the field of EWOD research and development.

                eDrops Community is an <strong>open-source platform</strong> that provides a space for anyone interested in 
                microfluidics to come together and share their projects and ideas. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Outside of designing the website, I was also tasked with creating creative videos showcasing the capabilities of UCLA's fabricated EWOD chips. 
                Working with PhD students allowed me to gain firsthand experience in the research process and expose myself to the world of academia.
