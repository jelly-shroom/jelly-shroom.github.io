    I started drawing cursed images in high school, 
    and they stay as some of my favorite drawings. Some 
    people find them scary, but I just find them funny. It's 
    nice to **break free** from the mindset of having creating a 
    "perfect" piece of art by deliberately making something ugly and weird.
