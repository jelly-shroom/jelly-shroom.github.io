<h1 slot="header">
  [eDrops Community](https://community.edroplets.org/) is a platform dedicated to building a collaborative hub to inspire electrowetting 
  on dielectric (EWOD) research and development.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    During my internship at UCLA's micro and nano manufacturing lab, I was tasked with designing a 
    website centered around building a **community** for digital microfluidics enthusiasts, welcoming both beginners 
    and experts in the field. The goal was to create a platform that would inspire **collaboration and innovation** in the field of EWOD research and development.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    eDrops Community is an **open-source platform** that provides a space for anyone interested in microfluidics to come together and share their projects and ideas.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Outside of designing the website, I was also tasked with creating creative videos showcasing the capabilities 
    of UCLA's fabricated EWOD chips. Working with PhD students allowed me to gain firsthand experience in the research process and expose myself to the world of academia.

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    The current state of the field surrounding EWOD technology is **fragmented**, with research and 
    development scattered across various institutions and companies that have **little collaboration** between them. 
    Additionally, there is lack of resources to make this technology **accessible** to the public and beginners.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    eDrops Community is a platform that aims to **unify** the EWOD community by providing a space for researchers, 
    students, and enthusiasts to come together and **inspire** one another. This platform features a forum for discussions 
    and project library for users to **share** their work and resources.
  </p>
</ProblemSolutionStatement>

<PageSection>
  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Research</h2>
  <p slot="description">
    EWOD technology is greatly **inaccessible** to the public due to its high level of skill entry, 
    and the lack of standardization results in **no interoperability** between different devices 
    produced by different institutions. This also leads to an inefficient production process, as 
    individual labs are forced to design and manufacture their own chips from scratch.

  <p slot="description">
    This project was my first exposure to working in a team alongside a developer and a project manager. 
    Throughout the entire design process, I was in **constant communication** with the developer and manager 
    to ensure that the designs were feasible and aligned with the project's goals.
