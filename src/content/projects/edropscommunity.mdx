<h1 slot="header">
  <a href="https://community.edroplets.org/" target="_blank">eDrops Community</a> is a platform dedicated to building a collaborative hub to inspire electrowetting 
  on dielectric (EWOD) research and development.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    During my internship at UCLA's micro and nano manufacturing lab, I was tasked with designing a 
    website centered around building a **community** for digital microfluidics enthusiasts, welcoming both beginners 
    and experts in the field. The goal was to create a platform that would inspire **collaboration and innovation** in the field of EWOD research and development.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    eDrops Community is an **open-source platform** that provides a space for anyone interested in microfluidics to come together and share their projects and ideas.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Outside of designing the website, I was also tasked with creating creative videos showcasing the capabilities 
    of UCLA's fabricated EWOD chips. Working with PhD students allowed me to gain firsthand experience in the research process and expose myself to the world of academia.

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    The field of EWOD technology is currently in a **fragmented** state, with research and 
    development scattered across various institutions that have **little collaboration** between them. 
    Additionally, there is lack of resources to make this technology **accessible** to the public and beginners.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    eDrops Community is a platform that aims to **unify** the EWOD community by providing a space for researchers, 
    students, and enthusiasts to come together and **inspire** one another. This platform features a forum for discussions 
    and project library for users to **share** their work and resources.
  </p>
</ProblemSolutionStatement>

<PageSection>
  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Research</h2>
  <p slot="description">
    EWOD technology is greatly **inaccessible** to the public due to its high level of skill entry, 
    and the lack of standardization results in **no interoperability** between different devices 
    produced by different institutions. This also leads to an inefficient production process, as 
    individual labs are forced to design and manufacture their own chips from scratch.

    This project was my first exposure to working in a team alongside a developer and a project manager. 
    Throughout the entire design process, I was in **constant communication** with the developer and manager 
    to ensure that the designs were feasible and aligned with the project's goals.

  <div  slot="description">
      <h3>Academia is a scary place.</h3>
        <p>
            Just kidding! But in all seriousness, working with PhD students was a very eye-opening experience. 
            While it may seem fun to go into research and just do a deep dive into a topic you're passionate about, 
            seeing it with my own eyes made me realize that it's not all fun and games. I would watch the students 
            stay in the lab day in and day out, conducting experiments and drafting up their own papers. Hearing about 
            their experiences within academia made me realize doing a deep dive into a topic you're passionate about comes 
            with a lot of **other responsibilities and stressors** that I hadn't considered before.
        </p>

        <br /><br />

          <h3>Working with a team is completely different from working alone.</h3>
          <p>
              This was my first time working with a team on a project, and it was such an interesting experience. 
              Before, I would be the one to make all the decisions and do all the work. In a team, it was more 
              about **collaboration and communication**. Working with a developer ensured that my designs were feasible, 
              and working with a project manager ensured that the project was on track according to their vision, rather 
              than my own. All this meant that I had to be **flexible and open-minded** to other people's ideas and opinions. 
              I would be sending emails back and forth with the developer and manager, asking if certain designs were possible 
              and which ones would be the best to implement. It was a lot of back and forth, but it was a great learning experience.
          </p>

          <br /><br />

          <h3>It's a lot of public speaking.</h3>
          <p>
              Every Friday we would have a group presentation to the professor to discuss our work throughout 
              the week and next steps. It was definitely a nerve-wracking experience, especially since the professor was 
              critical with his critiques, but it was a great way to practice my **public speaking** skills. While I wouldn't have 
              voluntarily put myself through this experience, I am immensely grateful that I had to go through the process of defending 
              my thought processes and decisions. This taught me so much about how to present my work in a way that is **understandable 
              and engaging** to others while **cutting the BS**.
