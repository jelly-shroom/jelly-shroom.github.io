  <span style="color: var(--darkAccent)">DigiSense</span> is a wristwatch that
  helps children with dyscalculia strengthen their understanding of time and
  numbers through visual learning aids.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    I wanted to challenge myself to design a solution for a market of people who
    operate outside of the typical user experience, where existing solutions are
    not tailored to their needs. **Dyscalculia** is a condition that impairs a
    person's **understanding** of basic mathematical concepts, which in turn
    impacts their **perception of time**.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    DigiSense emerges as a solution to **empower** children with dyscalculia by
    combining intuitive interfaces with innovative visualization techniques to
    bridge the gap between **abstract mathematical concepts and real-world
    experiences**.
  </p>
</div>

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
   Dyscalculia greatly reducees a child's ability to **connect visual symbols** to their assigned values. 
   This makes it difficult for them to understand and percieve the passage of time, which can lead to **anxiety and frustration** in their daily lives.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    DigiSense empowers children with dyscalculia to be more **confident and independent** in their daily lives by providing 
    them with assistive UI elements to help them **visualize time** and strengthen their **understanding** of numbers.
  </p>
</ProblemSolutionStatement>

  <p slot="description">
    Dyscalculia is a condition that is often **misunderstood and
    underdiagnosed**, and there is a **lack of resources** available to help
    children with dyscalculia succeed in their daily lives and in school. It is
    often thought of as "number dyslexia", and current interventions in therapy
    typically involve counting exercises and relying on physical tools to help
    **visualize** numbers.

  <p slot="description">
    I wanted to create a product that would be **intuitive and easy to understand** for children with dyscalculia, 
    so I started with designing the UI elements and learning aids that would be used to help them visualize time and numbers. 
    I then moved on to designing a more **child-friendly and engaging** form factor for the wristwatch.
