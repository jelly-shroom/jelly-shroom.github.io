<h1 slot="header">
  How might a social media platform that is designed for discovering new topics be explored through a 360° navigation system?
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    Modern day social media sucks its users into a never-ending rabbithole of 
    echo chambers through its algorithms, pushing content its users 
    already agree with and limiting their exposure to new ideas and perspectives. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Menace is a social media platform that aims to break this cycle by 
    providing users with a **360° navigation system** that allows them to 
    explore new topics and ideas in a more immersive and engaging way. 
    The concept of incorporating a 360° navigation system reflects the 
    idea of **breaking free** from the constraints of traditional social media, 
    where users are limited to a linear feed of content that easily traps 
    them into the cycle of doomscrolling.
  </p>
</div>

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    The current social media landscape is **fragmented and isolating**, 
    with users often stuck in echo chambers that limit their exposure to new ideas and perspectives. 
    This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy between different groups of people, 
    as well as a lack of engagement with new topics and ideas.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    Menace aims to address these issues by providing users with a 360° navigation system 
    that allows them to explore new topics and ideas in a more immersive and engaging way. 
    This system provides users with a more **holistic view** of the content available on the platform and 
    provides additional avenues for **exploration** of new topics.
  </p>

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Design criteria</h2>
  <p slot="description">
    The aesthetic design of Menace must be intuitive, easy, and engaging to use while sticking to a neutral color palette of mostly black and white. 
    The sample websites provided by the client are highly interactive and filled with microinteractions. <s>In short, they want to make the devs suffer.</s>

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Research</h2>
  <p slot="description">
    I started my research with two competitors of Menace at the complete opposite ends of the spectrum: Instagram and Amo. From 
    there, I moved on to researching the value proposition of Menace and how it could differentiate itself from the competition. 
    Most of the reseaerch lies within the intersection between **business and user experience**: Most of my research focuses on 
    the intersection of business and user experience. Everything converges to this one question: *how might we we design a product 
    that guides users to actions aligning with our business goals while effectively communicating our value proposition?*

        <p>
            **Amo and Instagram** stand at opposite ends of the spectrum. Instagram is a very traditional social media platform, following 
            the expected norms of social media. Amo is a small app that leans heavily into the sandbox experience--users can explore freely with 
            no constraints, but it lacks **structure**. It starts off as a blank canvas, and users have to build up their own "homepage" from scratch. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Menace aims to strike a balance between these two extremes. It aims to provide the structure Instagram has while allowing users to 
            explore freely with the 360° navigation system like Amo. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="halfColumn">
        <p>
            Based off of observations of the comparison between Amo and Instagram as well as the problem Menace aims to solve, I came up with 3 key 
            value propositions to focus on for Menace: **community, discovery, and interactivity**. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            From there, I started brainstorming different individual features 
            that reflect these values, such as users being able to affect each other's feeds, being pushed the interests of people geographically 
            close to them, and being able to collect different topics like trophies. I let this guide my design decisions moving forward, especially 
            when it came to figuring out the **user flow**.

    I wanted to create a product that would be **intuitive and easy to understand** for children with dyscalculia, 
    so I started with designing the UI elements and learning aids that would be used to help them visualize time and numbers. 
    I then moved on to designing a more **child-friendly and engaging** form factor for the wristwatch.
