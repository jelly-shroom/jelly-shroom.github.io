  <h1 slot="header">
    <span style="color: var(--darkAccent)">Study Garden</span> is a productivity app that gamifies the task management experience by rewarding focus and task completion.
  </h1>
  <div slot="overviewDescription">
    Study Garden was born out of a desire to better understand Unity and game development as a designer. 
    Even though design may not require coding, it is important to understand the **limitations and possibilities** of the tools that developers use. 
    As I started working professionally on projects that were built with Unity, I realized that I needed to understand the engine and all it's capabilities 
    better in order to design more **effectively**.
  <br />
    While many productivity apps focus on tracking habits or organizing tasks, this project aims to make completing tasks a 
    **rewarding experience** by providing an interactive and aesthetically pleasing environment where users can cultivate a garden 
    based on their efforts. In Study Garden, users set specific tasks and goals. Completing these tasks and maintaining 
    focus earns virtual currency that can be spent on new plants and decorations for their virtual garden. As the garden grows, 
    so does the user's sense of accomplishment, reinforcing positive behaviors while offering a **playful creative outlet**.
  </div>
</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot="problem">
    Staying focused and consistently completing tasks is a common challenge, especially in an increasingly **distracted** world. 
    Traditional task management apps often lack the incentive to **motivate** users or make productivity enjoyable. 
    Without rewards, completing tasks can feel like a chore.
  </p>
  <p slot="solution">
    Study Garden **gamifies** productivity. Through completing tasks and maintaining focus, users will be able to grow their 
    garden and unlock new plants and decorations.
    This approach combines task management with gamification, making the process both **engaging and visually rewarding**.
  </p>

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Research</h2>
  <div slot="description">
    I explored the psychology behind productivity apps and gamification, identifying that users are 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/documents/139799/1279149990/04+Article+Final_camildah_fors%C3%B8k_2017-12-06-13-53-55_TPD4505.Camilla.Dahlstr%C3%B8m.pdf">more motivated</a> 
    when they have a tangible reward or progress to work toward. By providing a virtual garden that users can personalize and 
    grow over time, Study Garden leverages this motivation, offering a consistent sense of achievement. Inspiration was 
    also drawn from existing apps like **Habitica**, which gamifies habit-building, but with a stronger emphasis on **visual 
    creativity and design**.

<div class="columnContainer">
  Other popular examples with a heavier focus on visual design include **Forest** and **WaterDo**, which have demonstrated how attaching 
  a visual reward system to task completion can help users stay focused. 
  Forest encourages focus by letting users grow virtual trees that wither if they leave the app before completing their focus 
  sessions. WaterDo, on the other hand, combines task management with a playful interface where users pop bubbles that represent 
  completed tasks.

<div class="columnContainer">
  While these apps succeed in making productivity engaging, they focus more on **short-term** rewards 
  (like growing a single tree or popping a task bubble). Study Garden's main value is providing a persistent virtual 
  space where users continuously grow and customize their gardens as they complete more tasks. The focus is not just on 
  one-off rewards but on building something over time—a garden that reflects the user's **consistent efforts and progress**.
  Additionally, Study Garden takes a more creative approach by emphasizing visual and spatial design. 
  While apps like Forest and WaterDo offer predefined visuals and limited customization, Study Garden allows users to 
  **curate and design** their garden, giving them a sense of ownership and expression that goes beyond simple task tracking.

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Process</h2>
  <div slot="description">
    The development has been an ongoing learning experience focused on gaining familiarity with Unity and C#. 
    The early stages involved prototyping the core gameplay loop, creating a simple system for users to add tasks, 
    track focus sessions, earning rewards, and most importantly of all, storing game data.
    <br />
    Because my main focus for this project was to learn more about Unity's systems and its API, I tried to stay away from designing 
    assets as much as possible. As a solo project, designing assets from scratch would have taken away valuable time that I could invest in mastering Unity’s features. 
    I opted to use free assets from the Unity Asset Store whenever possible and focused on the **gameplay mechanics**.

<div class="columnContainer">
<div>
    While I had some programming experience with Unity before, this project introduced me to more complex concepts 
    like **data and file management** and the role of a **GameManager** in a game environment. The GameManager was 
    central to handling core game logic and managing game states. 
    In a game that relies on tracking user progress, having a reliable structure to save and load data is crucial. 
    This required me to implement persistent data storage while ensuring that the game remains responsive and consistent 
    even as the player interacts with multiple systems. 
    <br/>
    The data management system was probably the most challenging system to implement for me. Some objects can't be referenced directly, so I had to create 
    what had felt like a convoluted system of references to ensure that the data was being saved and loaded correctly. I think a good 90% of the 
    errors I encountered were either null or missing reference errors, and it took a lot of trial and error to get it right.

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Challenges</h2>
  <div slot="description">
    ### Developing a full, non-buggy product takes a lot of time
    I started this project with the assumption that this was going to be a simple one. After all, I deliberately chose 
    something simple. At its core, it's just managing data of some plants and currency. I was aware of how much work game dev 
    is going into this, but all my previous experiences were very **hacky**. I could crank out a functional 
    prototype in a day, but it would be filled with **placeholders and bugs**. 
    <br />
    As a hackathon enthusiast, I have already done my fair share of **quick and dirty** projects. This time, I wanted to flesh things 
    out as much as possible and make sure that the project was **scalable**. As I started debugging, I realized that 
    the smallest bugs are sometimes the most time consuming to fix. There were many times where I considered making something a 
    "feature" instead of fixing it, but I couldn't be satisfied with that. Sometimes, I think I went a bit overboard with debugging. There 
    was one "bug" where the images on buttons wouldn't be tinted when pressed when it worked completely fine, and I ended up making a 
    custom script just to fix that. There were so many other nit-picky things I wanted to fix, and each tiny issue could take hours. 
    It's those **small details** that make the product feel like an actual game rather than a hackathon project.
    <br />

      <div class="halfColumn">
        ### ButtonImageTint.cs

        <p class="caption">*My PlantBehavior script that started off as a simple movement handler grew to be my largest script*</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    Aside from bugs, there were also many **tiny features** that came to mind as I was developing. 
    The core gameplay loop was already implemented at this point, so there was no real need for any prioritization. Because of this, 
    it felt like a **never-ending project**. "It would be cool if the environment changed based on the time of day" -- 
    "Why don't we have multiple songs and backgrounds and make it randomized each time you enter focus mode?" 
    Eventually, I realized I needed to **get a grip and start PM-ing myself**. I decided to cut off all tweaking and coding by a certain date 
    no matter where I was at. I will always come up with more features that are "nice to have". If I kept going, I really will end up 
    making a full-fledged game. This was just a learning project.

    ### Learning new software will always be a bumpy road
    While I'm not new to Unity, it contains so many features and editor tools that I've never touched before. This project 
    contained a lot of **firsts** for me. I learned to work with in depth with Unity's **UI system**, which was a lot more complex than I thought. I 
    expected to get the hang of its Canvas system quickly as a designer, but it took 
    many many **failures** of trial and error to get the UI to work and respond the way I wanted it to. Only now does it 
    feel natural for me to work with.
    <br />
    Other than UI, this was my first time with **audio**, **video**, **tilemaps**, and **sprite editor**. Although I didn't dive as 
    deep into these as I did with the UI, simply implementing them opens up doors I otherwise wouldn't have known about.

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Next Steps</h2>
  <div slot="description">
    ### Onboarding and alerts
    The next steps for Study Garden would be to implement a more comprehensive onboarding process to guide new users through the app. 
    This would include a basic walkthrough of the features and how they're used. Currently, new users may not fully understand the 
    available features or how to interact with the game. A step-by-step introduction would help bridge this gap, ensuring that 
    users start off with a **clear understanding** of the app's core functionality. Additionally, integrating more contextual 
    alerts and notifications would provide essential **user feedback**. For instance, users should be notified when they've completed a 
    task, earned rewards, or when certain milestones are reached. Without these, the app can feel **unresponsive and confusing** 
    at times.
    <br />

    ### Expanding customization options
    Another priority is expanding the **variety** of plants, decorations, and layout options available in the garden. 
    Offering more customization choices will enhance user engagement by allowing players to personalize their garden further, and it is
    especially important since Study Garden's main differentiatiation is its focus on **visuals and customization**. 
    Adding seasonal items or themed content, such as holiday-specific plants, could introduce limited-time events and encourage 
    continued interaction.
    <br/>

    ### Refining the reward system
    The current reward system works well for motivating users, but there is room for improvement in how rewards **scale** as users 
    progress. Implementing more dynamic rewards based on task difficulty, streaks, or focus duration could make the game feel more 
    rewarding over time. This would create a stronger connection between effort and reward, helping users stay motivated as their 
    gardens grow.
    <br/>

    ### Optimization and cross-platform support
    As more features are added, performance optimization will become increasingly important. Further work is needed to ensure that 
    scene transitions remain smooth and that the game performs consistently even with a fully decorated garden. Bringing the game 
    to Android and iOS would also make it more accessible and reach a broader audience, opening up possibilities for mobile-specific 
    features like notifications and simplified touch controls.
