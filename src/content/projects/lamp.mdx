  This desk lamp is designed to maximize working space while providing moody and aesthetic ambient lighting.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    This was the final project for my Product Design class, ACAD-245. The task was to design a 
    light source, and as a college student, what would be more fitting than a desk lamp for those 
    late-night study sessions? I also could not get the idea of creating something culturally representative 
    out of my head with the Mid-Autumn Festival just passing by, so I decided to incorporate some Chinese elements into the design.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This lamp is designed to provide a warm and **aesthetic** ambient light for the user's dorm room while also **maximizing space** on their desk.
  </p>
</div>

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    Many desk lamps tend to take up a lot of **space**, which can be a problem 
    for college students with limited space in their dorms. Additionally, 
    the lighting from these lamps can be too harsh, which can be **distracting and uncomfortable** for the user.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    This lamp is designed to have **storage space** for small items to help the user keep 
    their desk organized and make use of the space it takes up. The lighting on this lamp 
    is also arranged to be diffused to provide a **more comfortable** light for the user.

  <p slot="description">
    Since this was the final project and the professor wanted to give us 
    space to create something that we were passionate about, we were given 
    a lot of freedom in terms of what we ended up doing with the design. 
    I, along with many of my classmates wanted to create something that was 
    more **personal and artistic**. This definitely made it harder to create something 
    that fell within the constraints of the research we did, but going through 
    that process at least helped us understand what was already out there and 
    what we could do to make our product stand out.

  <p slot="description">
    In true experimental college fashion, we were actually tasked 
    with using **AI image generators** to help us in our sketching and 
    ideation process! This was a really interesting experience-by using 
    AI to render sketches, it ended up becoming an exchange of ideas between 
    me and the AI, iterating upon whatever it spits out. This definitely 
    helped me come up with some ideas that I would not have thought of otherwise.
