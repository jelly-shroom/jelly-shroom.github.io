<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    This was a project borne out of the <strong>MIT Reality Hack 2024</strong>
    hackathon, where our team envisioned a more
    <strong>connected future</strong> between patients and doctors. We
    recognized there was a pervasive fear and mistrust of doctors that stemmed
    from a <strong>lack of transparency</strong>, and we saw immersive
    technology as a tool to bridge that gap.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    For this hackathon, we focused on designing an experience for the
    <strong>pre-surgery consultation</strong> of a <strong>
      lung removal surgery
    </strong>.

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    Just one medical horror story is enough to deter many of us from seeking critical medical care.
    Up to <strong>92%</strong> of patients experience <strong>anxiety and doubt</strong> before going under an operation, and 
    the most impactful stressor is psychological: <strong>patient mistrust of doctors</strong>. When patients don't trust their medical professionals, 
    they end up refusing life-saving care.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    Dr. Trust allows doctors to <strong>educate and reassure</strong> patients by generating 
    3D visualizations from their medical scans to provide an accurate representation
    of their current condition. Both doctors and patients can interact with this model to call attention to specific areas, allowing 
    patients to clearly <strong>understand their diagnosis and treatment options</strong>.
  </p>
</ProblemSolutionStatement>

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Research</h2>
  <p slot="description">
    The majority of XR software in the medical field is tailored for medical
    professionals and lacks <strong>patient-oriented design</strong>. Thousands
    of horrendous medical stories are shared on social media platforms, and the
    fear of becoming one of these stories is enough to deter many from seeking
    proper medical care. This feeds into the prevalent <strong>mistrust</strong>
    of medical professionals. With a few hours of research, we found that by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15122417/" target="_blank">providing
    more information</a> to patients, we
    can <strong>reduce their anxiety</strong>
    and <strong>increase their trust</strong> in their doctors.
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection>
  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Process</h2>
  <p slot="description">
    I mainly worked on the 3D visualizations of the program, working in{" "}
    <strong>Blender</strong> to model and texture all the assets, and then
    importing them into <strong>Bezi</strong> to prototype the spatial design
    and interactions.

  <p slot="body">
    Our vision for Dr. Trust extends beyond pre-surgery consultations. Providing
    patients with a visual representation of their current condition is an
    incredibly powerful experience, and that can be expanded to{" "}
    <strong>all medical diagnoses</strong>. By expanding our application to
    encompass a wide range of medical conditions and procedures, Dr. Trust
    empowers patients with greater <strong>understanding and agency</strong> in
    their healthcare journey.

<h2 slot="sectionTitle">Reflections</h2>
  <div  slot="description">
      <h3>Things don't always go as planned.</h3>
        <p>
            Even after setting up our projectâ€™s real-time collaboration to work seamlessly when we tried it out, there was a lot of <strong>lag or even disconnection</strong>
            when we ran it for judges while everyone was also on WiFi. However, we were able to pull through and present our project to the best of our abilities
            given the circumstances.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Each one of us naturally fell into a role in an attempt to keep things afloat: <strong>Steven</strong> was on maintenance, getting the judge's headset to connect properly
            after each use, <strong>Amanda</strong> was guiding the demo when it did work, <strong>Vikram</strong> and <strong>Coco</strong> pitched to the judges while maintenance was happening, and I fell into 
            the role of being the <strong>line of communication</strong> between the pitchers and maintenance, hustling back and forth to make sure everyone was on the same page.
        </p>

        <br /><br />

          <h3>Don't be shy to explore new territories!</h3>
          <p>
              While I didn't get the chance to step into an entirely foreign role during the hackathon like some of my other teammates, I was still able to
              <strong>explore a new software</strong> and learn how to prototype spatial designs, behaviors, and interactions within <strong>Bezi</strong>.
              Working with a software that is still in its beta version came with its own set of challenges, but the experience of figuring out why
              something was behaving a certain way and finding workarounds to bugs was incredibly rewarding -
              special thanks to <strong>Julian Park</strong> and <strong>Daniel Marqusee</strong> for helping us troubleshoot!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
              Even though this was my first hackathon, I can already see how easy it is to fall into the trap of sticking to the same
              <strong>familiar roles</strong> every time. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have explored something new, and
              moving forward, I hope to <strong>push myself even further</strong> out of my comfort zone. Maybe I'll even be a dev next time around :)
          </p>

          <br /><br />

          <h3>It's all about having fun.</h3>
          <p>
              I like to approach each new experience with a sense of <strong>curiosity and enthusiasm</strong>, and this hackathon was no exception.
              It's natural to feel a little scared or overwhelmed when you're trying something new, but it can be equally as exciting
              to discover what these new experiences have to offer. Setting foot into MIT and meeting all these industry leaders, PhD students,
              working professionals, and others from vastly different backgrounds was an incredibly <strong>intimidating but exciting</strong> experience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
              I experienced some of the best teamwork and dynamics with my team, <strong>"4 Trojans + 1 Tree"</strong>,
              and I have made some of my most favorite memories with them. Within the span of just 5 days (2.5 days of hacking!), we went from being
              <strong>strangers to friends</strong> who have known each other for a lifetime. There wasn't a single moment where I felt
              overwhelmed or stressed out during the hack, even through the all nighters and mind numbing bugs, simply because I had so much
              <strong>fun</strong> working with them.
