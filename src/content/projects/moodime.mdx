  **MoodiMe** is a wellness app that helps guide users towards a more balanced lifestyle through insights based on their mood and habits.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    While fluctuations in mood are a normal part of life, they can sometimes be a sign of underlying issues that need to be addressed. 
    A lack of awareness regarding one's emotional fluctuations becomes a barrier to seeking help and making positive changes.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    MoodiMe is a wellness app that helps users track their **mood and habits** to find patterns and provide 
    **personalized recommendations** to empower users to take control of their mental health and well-being.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Outside of designing the website, I was also tasked with creating creative videos showcasing the capabilities 
    of UCLA's fabricated EWOD chips. Working with PhD students allowed me to gain firsthand experience in the research process and expose myself to the world of academia.

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    Many people realize the importance of understanding how their dailiy habits and lifestyle 
    choices affect their mood, but they often **lack the tools** to do so. The most common reason 
    people don't track their moods and behaviors is because they think it's **"too much work"** 
    or too **difficult to manage** the data.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    MoodiMe aims to streamline the process of tracking mood and habits by providing 
    a **simple and intuitive** interface while still providing a **comprehensive** collection of 
    data. The app will provide **personalized** insights to help users 
    understand their mood patterns and make positive changes.

  <p slot="description">
    With 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 5 adolescents in the U.S. 
    experiencing mental illness each year, it is more important 
    than ever to provide tools that help people understand and manage 
    their mental health. Emotional regulation is a key component of 
    mental health and well-being, and research articles have shown that 
    one's daily habits have a significant impact on their ability to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3817414/">regulate their emotions</a>.

  <p slot="description" >
    My vision for MoodiMe involved an **organic yet modern** feel, 
    keeping a balance between the two to create a calming and inviting 
    atmosphere. This involved thoughtful design of not just the UI but the icons as well.
