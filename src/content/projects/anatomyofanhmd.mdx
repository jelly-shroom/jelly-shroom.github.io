    Exploring educational MR experiences through the Apple Vision Pro
  </h1>
  <div slot="overviewDescription">
    A quick and dirty project with a few classmates to explore the capabilities of the Apple Vision Pro. 
    We wanted to create an interactive experience that breaks down the components of the Wide5 HMD headset in 
    a fun and engaging manner.

  <p slot="description">
    With access to the MxR Lab founded by Mark Bolas, we were inspired by the huge display of VR and AR headsets sitting out in the 
    hallway. Staring at the headsets, we thought it would be interesting to create an educational experience that breaks down the 
    inner components of a headset while making it engaging and fun to interact with. With the help of an [old post](https://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=13741) by 
    Palmer Luckey, we were able to gather enough information about the Wide5 HMD to create an informative experience.
