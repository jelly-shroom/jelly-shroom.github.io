  <p>
    This was an assignment in my Mixed Media class during high school, and we were tasked 
    with creating any piece of artwork using charcoal on our handmade toned paper. Knowing 
    I will be off to college soon, I wanted to create a piece that preserved a moment in my dog's everyday life. 
    Sometimes, when you take a step back and observe the little things, you realize how precious they are.
