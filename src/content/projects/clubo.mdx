  <span style="color: var(--darkAccent)">Clu-Bo</span> is a robot designed to
  help children with nonverbal learning disorders hone their social skills and
  recognize subtle social cues.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    I wanted to take on the challenge of designing a product that would help
    with **social challenges** that people may face in their daily lives. I
    decided to focus on nonverbal learning disorders (NLD), which are a group of
    disorders that affect a person's ability to **interpret nonverbal cues**.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Clu-Bo is a solution crafted to help children with NLD **recognize and
    interpret** social cues through **engaging and interactive activiites** that
    help them practice and strengthen their social skills.
  </p>
</div>

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    NLDs are a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to **interpret nonverbal cues** such as body language, 
    facial expressions, and tone of voice. This can make it **frustrating** for children with NLD to understand social situations and communicate effectively.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    Clu-Bo is a **social companion** designed to **empower** children with NLDs in social situations. 
    It uses expressive facial features and body language to help children **recognize and interpret** social cues in a fun and engaging way.
  </p>

  <p slot="description">
    Typical interventions for NLDs include teaching social stories and flash
    cards to help younger children understand social cues, and if left
    unattended, symptoms tend to worsen as children grow older.

    I wanted the form factor of Clu-Bo to be **approachable and friendly** while also allowing for **expressive and engaging** interactions. 
    Additionally, I wanted the app to be **simple and intuitive** as a way for parents and guardians to easily 
    control Clu-Bo and track their child's progress.
