  <span style="color: var(--darkAccent)">DigiSense</span> is a wristwatch that
  helps children with dyscalculia strengthen their understanding of time and
  numbers through visual learning aids.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    I wanted to challenge myself to design a solution for a market of people who
    operate outside of the typical user experience, where existing solutions are
    not tailored to their needs. **Dyscalculia** is a condition that impairs a
    person's **understanding** of basic mathematical concepts, which in turn
    impacts their **perception of time**.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    DigiSense emerges as a solution to **empower** children with dyscalculia by
    combining intuitive interfaces with innovative visualization techniques to
    bridge the gap between **abstract mathematical concepts and real-world
    experiences**.
  </p>
</div>

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
   Dyscalculia greatly reducees a child's ability to **connect visual symbols** to their assigned values. 
   This makes it difficult for them to understand and percieve the passage of time, which can lead to **anxiety and frustration** in their daily lives.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    DigiSense empowers children with dyscalculia to be more **confident and independent** in their daily lives by providing 
    them with assistive UI elements to help them **visualize time** and strengthen their **understanding** of numbers.
  </p>
</ProblemSolutionStatement>

  <h2 slot="sectionTitle">Research</h2>
  <p slot="description">
    Dyscalculia is a condition that is often **misunderstood and
    underdiagnosed**, and there is a **lack of resources** available to help
    children with dyscalculia succeed in their daily lives and in school. It is
    often thought of as "number dyslexia", and current interventions in therapy
    typically involve counting exercises and relying on physical tools to help
    **visualize** numbers.

  <Interview pfp={Weasel} name="Wesley Lim">
    <p slot="info">20 years old</p>
    <p slot="furtherInfo">
      Clinically diagnosed with dyscalculia since second grade
    </p>

    <div slot="interview">
        <h3>How did you get your diagnosis?</h3>
        <p>
            When I was in second grade, my teachers noticed I was **constantly using fingers** and had difficulty doing 
            the most basic addition and subtraction. My teacher recommended that I get tested, so my parents took me to a specialist and I got diagnosed with dyscalculia.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What do you do to keep track of time?</h3>
        <p>
            **I don't keep track of time**. I just write down everything I have to do, and I will never know how long something takes. I can't even give you an estimate.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How does the uncertainty of a task's duration present challenges in your day-to-day?</h3>
        <p>
            I'm always **worried about being late** to events so I end up going to places super early. 
            I will have no idea how much time has passed and I end up just **waiting around** for a long time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Tell me about your experience when trying to tell time elapsed using a clock.</h3>
        <p>
            I take a long time and have to **count with my fingers**. (Counting the time passed between 3:45 - 4:06) That's 21 minutes, right? 
            I counted 22 the first time then **double checked**.

  <Interview pfp={Bonnie} name="Bonnie Weiss">
    <p slot="info">Educational therapist</p>
    <p slot="furtherInfo">
      Owner/Director of [The Family and Learning Center](https://tfalc.com/)
    </p>

    <div slot="interview">
        <h3>How would you describe dyscalculia?</h3>
        <p>
            Dyscalculia is a **math-related learning disability** that stems from challenges in **visual-spatial processing**, 
            so it's difficult for people with dyscalculia to link the abstract meaning of something to its symbolic representation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What are some tools and exercises used to help people with dyscalculia?</h3>
        <p>
            We use a variety of tools such as unit blocks, the number line, and just counting the number of **physical objects** in everyday life. 
            Some of the tools that appear in school that can be helpful are multiplication tables, since it gives them a **visual representation** of the numbers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What are some currently available solutions that help people with dyscalculia visualize the passage of time?</h3>
        <p>
            **Visual indications** such as **progress bars** are definitely helpful. Learning to read analogue clocks help with getting a sense 
            of how much time has passed rather than just seeing a number on a digital clock. **Time Timers** are a great tool that implement progress 
            bars as a visual representation of time passing.

        <h3>Roman numeral system</h3>
            <p>
                The Roman system relies heavily on the memorization of complex rules and symbol combinations to 
                determine the overall value of a numeral. It requires a strong association between the **symbols** and their **values**, 
                and similar systems will only serve to confuse children with dyscalculia.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Mayan numeral system</h3>
            <p>
                The Mayan system follows a clear pattern and straightforward rules, relying heavily on lines and dots to represent numbers. 
                Having only 2 neccessary symbols to represent numbers makes this system **intuitive and easy** to understand, making it a great 
                candidate for visual learning aids.

        <h3>Pinyin</h3>
            <p>
                Pinyin is a system of romanization for standard Mandarin Chinese, and it is used to teach children how to read and write Chinese 
                characters. It uses the latin alphabet to represent the sounds of characters, making it a great example of how **visual learning aids** 
                can be used to bridge the gap between **abstract concepts and real-world experiences**.

    <div>
        <h3>Progress bars</h3>
            <p>
                Progress bars are a great example of how **visual indications** can be used to represent the passage of time. 
                They are **simple and intuitive** to understand, and they are often used in everyday life to help people visualize a task's duration, 
                progress, or completion. **Time Timers** are a great tool that implement progress bars as a visual representation of time passing.
