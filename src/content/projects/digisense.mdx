  <span style="color: var(--darkAccent)">DigiSense</span> is a wristwatch that helps children with dyscalculia strengthen their 
  understanding of time and numbers through visual learning aids.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    I wanted to challenge myself to design a solution for a market of people who operate outside of the typical user experience, 
    where existing solutions are not tailored to their needs. **Dyscalculia** is a condition that impairs a person's **understanding** of 
    basic mathematical concepts, which in turn impacts their **perception of time**.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    DigiSense emerges as a solution to **empower** children with dyscalculia by combining intuitive interfaces with 
    innovative visualization techniques to bridge the gap between **abstract mathematical concepts and real-world experiences**.
  </p>
</div>

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
   Dyscalculia greatly reducees a child's ability to **connect visual symbols** to their assigned values. 
   This makes it difficult for them to understand and percieve the passage of time, which can lead to **anxiety and frustration** in their daily lives.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    DigiSense empowers children with dyscalculia to be more **confident and independent** in their daily lives by providing 
    them with assistive UI elements to help them **visualize time** and strengthen their **understanding** of numbers.
  </p>
</ProblemSolutionStatement>

  <p slot="description">
    Dyscalculia is a condition that is often **misunderstood and underdiagnosed**, and there is a **lack of resources** available 
    to help children with dyscalculia succeed in their daily lives and in school. It is often thought of as "number dyslexia", and 
    current interventions in therapy typically involve counting exercises and relying on physical tools to help **visualize** numbers.
