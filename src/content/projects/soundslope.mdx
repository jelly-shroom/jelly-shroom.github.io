  **SoundSlope** is a wearable speaker that effortlessly integrates into a skier's gear while delivering high quality sound.
</h1>
<div slot="overviewDescription">
  <p>
    This was a project for my Product Design class, ACAD-245. We 
    were split into different groups to takle different categories 
    of products, and I landed in the "bluetooth speaker" group. We 
    did preliminary research and ideations as a team, but we split off 
    individually when it came to putting our ideations onto paper. From 
    the sketching process onwards, we all ended up with vastly different 
    products targeting different niches.

  <p>
    SoundSlope is a wearable speaker that is designed to be integrated into a 
    skier's gear so that it can be worn comfortably without inhibiting any **movement**.

</Overview>

<ProblemSolutionStatement>
  <p slot='problem'>
    Many people who do extreme sports often enjoy listening 
    to music through speakers, but the current options available 
    are often **bulky and uncomfortable** to bring along. They tend to 
    hinder movement and can be **easily damaged** by the elements.
  </p>

  <p slot="solution">
    SoundSlope is a **compact and portable** speaker that can be securely attached 
    over a skier's gloves. It is designed to seamlessly integrate with the skier's
    **movements**, allowing them to enjoy their music without any distractions or discomfort.

  <p slot="description">
    In this class, our research was mainly focused on the options that are currently 
    available in the market and figuring out how we can differentiate ourselves from them.

  <p slot="description">
    After the initial research stages, everyone broke off to do their own individual sketches 
    and ideations for the product. I started off without knowing what audience I wanted to target, 
    but I eventually settled on skiers because I felt the wearable form factor was sleek and 
    could be an interesting idea to explore further.
